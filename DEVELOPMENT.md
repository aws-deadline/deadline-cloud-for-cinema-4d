# AWS Deadline Cloud for Cinema4D Development

This package has two active branches:

- `mainline` -- For active development. This branch is not intended to be consumed by other packages. Any commit to this branch may break APIs, dependencies, and so on, and thus break any consumer without notice.
- `release` -- The official release of the package intended for consumers. Any breaking releases will be accompanied with an increase to this package's interface version.
## Build / Test / Release

### Build the package

```bash
hatch build
```

### Run tests

```bash
hatch run test
```

### Run linting

```bash
hatch run lint
```

### Run formatting

```bash
hatch run fmt
```

## Run tests for all supported Python versions

```bash
hatch run all:test
```

## Submitter environment

Cinema4D does not support PYTHONPATH. We set DEADLINE_CLOUD_PYTHONPATH which the
submitter and adaptor uses to set sys.path explictly and load deadline modules.

- install deadline-cloud with pyside
- set env below

```
# deadline-cloud lib with pyside
export DEADLINE_CLOUD_PYTHONPATH="/path/to/deadline-cloud/site-packages"
# configure cinema4d to find extension entry point
export g_additionalModulePath="/path/to/deadline-cloud-for-cinema4d/deadline_cloud_extension"
```

- run cinema4d
- Extensions > Deadline Cloud Submitter

## Worker adaptor environment

Cinema4D does not support PYTHONPATH. We set DEADLINE_CLOUD_PYTHONPATH which the
adaptor uses to set sys.path explictly and load deadline modules.

### Linux

Linux also requires the setup_c4d_env sourced first, we can override the exe
path with a c4d wrapper script that sources it then call the Commandline
client.

Example linux env below:

```
export DEADLINE_CLOUD_PYTHONPATH="/tmp/lib/python3.11/site-packages"
export DEADLINE_CINEMA4D_EXE="/opt/maxon/cinema4dr2024.200/bin/c4d"
```

### Windows

To run the adaptor on Windows, you'll have to configure the environment variable `DEADLINE_CLOUD_PYTHONPATH` (like the submitter above) and install pywin32 into Cinema4D's python. Example:

```
set DEADLINE_CLOUD_PYTHONPATH="C:\path\to\deadline-cloud\site-packages"
"C:\Program Files\Maxon Cinema 4D 2024\resource\modules\python\libs\win64\python.exe" -m ensurepip   
"C:\Program Files\Maxon Cinema 4D 2024\resource\modules\python\libs\win64\python.exe" -m pip install pywin32  
```
